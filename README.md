A note taking web app that utilises a flat folder of markdown files for storage.

## Design Principle

For a long time now I've written and stored all of my personal notes in a simple folder of markdown files. I find that the simple, distraction free formatting helps me focus on the content and the storage medium frees me from being locked into any particular note taking app.

Still, I was unable to find an editor that ticked all the boxes:

- Support for flat folder storage
- Cross platform (web based)
- Mobile friendly
- Clean, simple interface
- Good markdown support for:
  - Tables
  - Code Blocks (Syntax Highlighting)
  - Task Lists
- Full text searching
- Support for embedding images (and storing them)
- Support for uploading file attachments
- Password authentication
- The ability to share notes as public read-only URLs

This is what flatnotes aims to achieve.
