A note taking web app that utilises a flat folder of markdown files for storage.

## Design Principle

For a long time now I've written and stored all of my personal notes in a simple folder of markdown files. I find that the simple, distraction free formatting helps me focus on the content and the storage medium frees me from being locked into any particular note taking app.

Still, I was unable to find an editor that ticked all the boxes:

* Support for flat folder storage
* Cross platform (web based)
* Mobile friendly
* Clean, simple interface
* Good markdown support for:
  * Tables
  * Code Blocks (Syntax Highlighting)
  * Task Lists
* Full text searching
* Support for embedding images (and storing them)
* Support for uploading file attachments
* Password authentication
* The ability to share notes as public read-only URLs

This is what flatnotes aims to achieve.
